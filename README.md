# MineSweeper
MineSweeper Angular App I built to practice Angular

Welcome to Minesweeper!
I made this game as practice with AngularJS during my time at Grand Circus Boot Camp as a side project. 

Instuctions:

GOAL: Reveal all cells that do not contain mines.

PLAYING THE GAME: To play, click on any cell. When revealed, a cell can contain nothing, a mine, or a number. If the cell contains
nothing, it will reveal all cells adjacent that do not contain mines (This repeats until the chain reaches a numbered cell). The number
in the cell describes how many adjacent cells contain mines. You can flag potential mines by clicking the flag at the top of the screen,
which toggles 'flagging mode'. Click it again to toggle it off.

ENDING THE GAME: The game will end if a mine is clicked or if all non-mine cells are revealed.
